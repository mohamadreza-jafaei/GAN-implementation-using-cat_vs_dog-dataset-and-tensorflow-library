# GAN Implementation using Cat vs Dog Dataset and TensorFlow Library
This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate images of cats and dogs using the Cat vs Dog dataset and TensorFlow library. In this project we implement FCGAN and DCGAN.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Cat vs Dog dataset, which consists of 25,000 images of cats and dogs for training and testing. The dataset is preprocessed and resized to 64x64 pixels for training the GAN model.

## Requirements
To run the project, you will need the following:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
NumPy
Matplotlib
